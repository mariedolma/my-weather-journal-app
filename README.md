# This is my Weather-Journal App Project!

## The project 
Create an asynchronous web app that uses the Weather Journal API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions were:
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.
